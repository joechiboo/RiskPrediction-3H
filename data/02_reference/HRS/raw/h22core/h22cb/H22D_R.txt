         I'll read a set of 10 words and ask you to recall as many as you can. We have
         purposely made the list long so that it will be difficult for anyone to recall
         all the words -- most people recall just a few. Please listen carefully as I
         read the set of words because I cannot repeat them. When I finish, I will ask
         you to recall aloud as many of the words as you can, in any order. Is this
         clear?
         
         INSTR: Probe as needed for understanding of task. Read the items at a slow,
         steady rate as they come up on the screen, approximately one word every two
         seconds.
         
         INSTR: If R refuses during or after the preamble and before any words are read,
         enter [Ctrl-R] at this screen

         Please pay careful attention as the words are displayed because they will not be

         many of the words as you can recall, in any order.

         Note: One of these 4 lists is randomly assigned to each R at variable x011. Each
         R in a household is assigned a different list. Only assigned words are displayed
         to the iwer, one word appearing at a time. The iwer reads each word to the R as
         it appears. The words automatically advance every 2 seconds, so the iwer does
         not press [Enter] to show the next word. The numerical codes for the words are
         not shown on the screen.

         In this task, on each screen you will be presented with several numbers that
         make up a series. 	There will be one or more empty boxes somewhere in the
         series. Sometimes the empty boxes will be at the end of the series, 	and
         sometimes they will be in the middle. Please look at the pattern of numbers and
         enter the number that goes in each empty box.

         Please enter the number that belongs in the empty box.

         I am now going to ask you six more questions like the one you just did. 
         Sometimes the blank will be at the end of the series, and sometimes it may be at
         the beginning or in the middle. You may be asked a question with more than one
         blank in the sequence. The numbers might increase, like 2, 4, 6, or decrease,
         like 6, 4, 2. Some of the problems may be easy but others may be hard. Just do
         the best you can. It is more important to answer the item correctly than to
         answer quickly, so take a little time to think before answering. It is okay if
         you do not know the answer because some of the items are intended to be very

         Now we want you to remember what [First Name] was like two years ago and to
         compare it with what [he/she] is like now. Two years ago was in [Year 2 years
         ago].
         
         I will read situations where [First Name] has to use [his/her] memory or
         intelligence and we would like you to indicate whether this has improved, stayed
         the same, or gotten worse in that situation over the past two years.
         
         Note the importance of comparing [his/her] present performance with two years
         ago. So if two years ago [First Name] always forgot where [he/she] had left
         things, and [he/she] still does, then this would be considered 'not much
         change'.
