         Employers sometimes encourage older workers to leave a firm at a particular time
         by offering a special financial incentive, like a cash bonus or improved pension
         benefits. These are often called 'early retirement windows.'
         
         Have you been offered such an early retirement window at any time since [Prev IW

         Employers sometimes encourage older workers to leave a firm at a particular time
         by offering a special financial incentive, like a cash bonus or improved pension
         benefits. These are often called 'early retirement windows.'
         
         Have you ever been offered such an early retirement window on any job?
