         worst off - who have the least money, least education, and the worst jobs or no
         jobs. The higher up you are on this ladder, the closer you are to the people at
         the very top and the lower you are, the closer you are to the people at the very
         bottom.
         
         Please mark an X on the rung on the ladder where you would place yourself.  Mark
