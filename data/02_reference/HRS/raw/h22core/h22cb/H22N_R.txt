         The next questions are about health insurance, both public and private. Medicare
         is a public health insurance program for people 65 or older and for disabled
         persons. Medicaid, which may be called something different in your state, is a
         public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
         
         Are you currently covered by Medicare health insurance?

         ALL:
         We would like to understand how people's medical history affects their financial
         status, and how use of health care may change as people age.  To do that, we
         need to obtain information about health care costs and diagnoses.
         
         IF WE DO NOT HAVE R's MEDICARE CONSENT FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE IW (Z113 NOT 1) AND
         DO NOT HAVE MEDICAID CONSENT FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE (Z277_PWHAVEMEDICAID NOT 1:
         The best place to get this information without taking up a lot more of your time
         is in the records from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.  Would you
         allow us to link to these data using your name and other information?
         
         IF WE HAVE R's MEDICARE CONSENT FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE IW (Z113=1) AND DO NOT HAVE
         R'S MEDICAID CONSENT FROM A PREVIOUS WAVE IW (Z277_PWHAVEMEDICAID NOT 1):
         You have already given permission to access your Medicare records.  Would you
         allow us to access any Medicaid records you may have?

         allow us to access any Medicare records you may have?
         
         DEF: Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or
         older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal
         Disease. Medicaid is a public health insurance program for people with low
         incomes.

         preventive care such as a mammogram, a cholesterol test, or a screening test for
         colon or other cancer.
