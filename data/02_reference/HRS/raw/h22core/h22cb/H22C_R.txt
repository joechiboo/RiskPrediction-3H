         normal but not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes.

         Did you have your hysterectomy after your last menstrual period, that is, after
         you went through menopause?
         
         DEF: Menopause is defined as the time when there have been no menstrual periods
         for 12 months in a row.  If your last period was a year or more before your
         hysterectomy then it occurred after menopause.

         Have you finished going through menopause?
         
         DEF: The end of menopause is defined as the time when there have been no
         menstrual periods for 12 months in a row. The changes of the menopause
         transition (perimenopause) begin about 6 years before natural menopause is all
         through. This is a time when the levels of hormones produced by the ovaries
         change, leading to irregular or less frequent menstrual periods and hot flashes.
         Other changes associated with the perimenopause and menopause include night
         sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness, changes in sexual desire (libido),
         forgetfulness, trouble sleeping and fatigue.

         The following questions are about colon cancer screening tests you can do at
         home. One kind is called the FIT test and another kind is called the FIT-DNA or
         Cologuard test. Both look for blood or other signs of colon cancer in your stool
         or bowel movement.
         
         Have you ever had a FIT test or a Cologuard test?
