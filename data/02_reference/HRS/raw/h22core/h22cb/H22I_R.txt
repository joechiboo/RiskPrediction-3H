         the 2022 Core survey.
         
         User Note: SNURSHM is a tracker file variable that is used to build SPMELIG
         (Physical Measures eligibility). Please be advised SNURSHM is used because there
         is additional evaluation after the field period to determine the nursing home
         status of respondents.  For this reason SNURSHM is used in place of the
         coverscreen variable that controls the flow of the interview.

         Now I am going to ask you to do a few simple activities for me.
         
         Researchers are interested in how performance on these activities relates to
         some of the other factors I have asked you about in the interview. I will ask
         you to do these activities: a hearing test, a breathing test, a test of hand
         strength, [a walking test,] a balance test, and blood pressure, height,
         [weight,] and waist measurements.
         
         
         My primary concern is for your safety, so I will ask you if you feel it would be
         safe for you to complete each activity. If you have any concerns about the
         activity, please let me know and we will skip it.
         
         Please do not eat, drink, smoke, or brush your teeth while we are conducting the
         measurements. I will also be asking you to remove bulky clothing and to take off
         your shoes during the measurements.

         Next, I would like to assess whether you can walk a very short distance
         comfortably (using a walking stick or other aid if necessary). Do you have any
         problems from recent surgery, injury, or other health conditions that might
         prevent you from walking?
