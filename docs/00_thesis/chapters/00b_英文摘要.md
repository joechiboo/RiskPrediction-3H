**Title**: Risk Prediction of Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Dyslipidemia: A Multi-Model Comparative Study

Hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia—collectively known as the "three highs"—are major chronic diseases and key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Conventional risk assessment methods rely on single-timepoint data, failing to capture the dynamic health trajectories embedded in longitudinal records.

We utilized a publicly available longitudinal dataset (Luo et al., 2024) comprising 6,056 adults aged 40+ followed from 2010 to 2018. A three-timepoint design (Y-2, Y-1, Y0) was adopted, using health indicators and delta features (Δ) to predict disease status. A sliding window approach generated 13,514 records. Eight models (traditional statistics, tree-based, Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural network) were compared, with symbolic regression exploring interpretability. StratifiedGroupKFold 5-fold cross-validation ensured no data leakage.

Key findings: (1) Logistic Regression achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.938 for hyperglycemia; (2) Δ features improved AUC by 1.5%–2.3% and comprised 30–50% of top 10 features; (3) SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed disease-specific predictors; (4) symbolic regression achieved AUC 0.943 with a minimal formula; (5) more checkup records improved performance; (6) top 5 features showed <0.5% AUC decrease.

This study demonstrates that longitudinal health checkup data with simple feature engineering can achieve clinically useful predictions, suitable for early warning systems in primary healthcare.
