**Title**: Predicting Hypertension, Hyperglycemia, and Dyslipidemia Using Longitudinal Health Checkup Data with Delta Features: A Multi-Model Comparative Study

Hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia—collectively known as the "three highs"—are major chronic diseases and key modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Conventional risk assessment methods rely on single-timepoint examination data, failing to capture the dynamic health trajectories embedded in longitudinal records. This study aims to leverage longitudinal health checkup data and delta features (Δ features) to predict future disease risk while balancing predictive accuracy and model interpretability.

We utilized a publicly available longitudinal health checkup dataset (Luo et al., 2024, Dryad repository) comprising 6,056 community-dwelling adults aged 40 and above from Hangzhou, China, followed between 2010 and 2018. A three-timepoint longitudinal design (Y-2, Y-1, Y0; approximately two-year intervals) was adopted, using health indicators and their changes (Δ features) from Y-2 and Y-1 as input to predict disease status at Y0. A sliding window approach generated 13,514 modeling records. Eight models were systematically compared: traditional statistical methods (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LDA), tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), kernel method (SVM), and neural network (MLP), with symbolic regression (PySR) additionally employed to explore interpretability. StratifiedGroupKFold 5-fold cross-validation ensured no data leakage across participants while maintaining class proportions in each fold.

Key findings include: (1) Logistic Regression demonstrated consistently strong performance across all three tasks, achieving AUC 0.938 for hyperglycemia prediction; (2) Δ features provided 1.5%–2.3% AUC improvement in data-limited scenarios (Y-1 only) and comprised 30–50% of the top 10 important features; (3) SHAP analysis revealed disease-specific predictors—SBP/DBP for hypertension, FBG for hyperglycemia, and TC/ΔeGFR for dyslipidemia; (4) symbolic regression discovered a minimal formula ($0.114 \times FBG_{Y-1}$) achieving AUC 0.943, demonstrating the practical potential of interpretable AI; (5) increasing health checkup frequency was positively correlated with prediction performance across all three diseases; and (6) using only the top 5 features resulted in less than 0.5% AUC decrease, confirming the feasibility of parsimonious models.

This study demonstrates that readily accessible longitudinal health checkup data, combined with simple feature engineering and linear models, can achieve clinically useful predictive performance without complex deep learning models or expensive laboratory tests, making it suitable for deployment as an early warning system in primary healthcare settings.
